# teraformer-game

In this game, you are in charge of colonizing a newly
discovered planet. You will have to mine resources to build
new buildings, terraform the planet to unlock new possibilities,
and even fight off enemies who want to sabotage your space
exploration and take the goods for themselves.

All of this is done in the form of fun minigames at buildings 
called stations.

As you build more buildings, you get more advantages in the minigames,
allowing you to get further in them, while finding new resources,
inventing new weapons and even discovering new celestial bodies
to colonize, which can potentially unlock more minigames, resulting
in more fun.
